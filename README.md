LifeSync Frontend MVPThis repository contains the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) frontend for the LifeSync compatibility evaluation platform, built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS CDN), and vanilla JavaScript. This MVP focuses on the Guest Assessment flow and displaying a temporary report.Project Goal: To provide a visually engaging and interactive guest assessment experience that demonstrates the core value of LifeSync and encourages user registration.Technology Stack:HTML5CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS CDN for utility classes)Vanilla JavaScriptFont Awesome (for icons)Architecture:Single-Page Application (SPA) structure using horizontal sections navigated via JavaScript.Features (MVP):Horizontal navigation between Home, Guest Assessment, and Guest Report sections.Dynamic loading and display of guest assessment questions (simulated or via API).User input capture for different question types (text, radio, scale).Display of cumulative feedback during the assessment (simulated or via API).Handling assessment completion.Display of a temporary guest report on the page.Basic modal functionality (Login, Signup, Message).Basic multi-language support (English, South African official languages + French, Portuguese, Shona, Swahili, Japanese, Mandarin) via JavaScript translation.Swipe gesture support for horizontal navigation on touch devices.File Structure:LifeSync/

Setup and Running Locally:This MVP is designed to be run directly in a web browser.Clone this repository to your local machine.Open the index.html file in your web browser.Note: The JavaScript includes placeholder API calls (YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL) for fetching questions and submitting answers/completion data. These calls will not work without a running backend API at the specified URL. For local frontend testing, you can uncomment the mockGuestQuestions and related mock functions in js/script.js to simulate backend behavior.Deployment on Namecheap Stellar Plus (Subdirectory):Ensure you have access to your Namecheap cPanel or FTP/SFTP.Navigate to your public_html directory.Create a new subdirectory (e.g., LifeSync).Upload the following files and folders into the LifeSync subdirectory:index.htmlcss/ (containing style.css)js/ (containing script.js).htaccessREADME.md (optional, but good practice)Important: Edit the .htaccess file and ensure the RewriteBase /LifeSync/ line correctly reflects the subdirectory name.Important: Edit the js/script.js file and replace YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL with the actual URL of your deployed backend API.Access your application in a web browser at https://yourdomain.com/LifeSync/.Backend (Assumed Existing):This frontend MVP is designed to interact with a separate Node.js/Express backend API. The backend is responsible for:Storing question data.Providing an endpoint to fetch guest questions (GET /api/guest/questions).Receiving guest answers and calculating/returning cumulative feedback (POST /api/guest/answer).Receiving all guest answers upon completion, generating a temporary report, storing it, and returning report data/token (POST /api/guest/complete).(Future) Providing an endpoint to fetch a guest report by token (GET /api/guest/report/:token).Future Development:This MVP provides a foundation. Future development will involve:Implementing the full backend API endpoints.Expanding the assessment questions and types.Implementing user registration and login.Developing registered user features (profiles, couple linking, full assessments, detailed reports, dashboards, progress tracking).Integrating external data sources (with user consent).Refining the compatibility scoring and typology logic.Implementing the full translation system (potentially loading translations from a separate file or backend).Developing native mobile applications.Contributing:[Instructions for contributing would go here in a full project, e.g., reporting issues, submitting pull requests.]License:[Specify your project license here.]
